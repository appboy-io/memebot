# **_Dank Meme Bot_**

Need a discord bot to pull media from your favorite message board? Anything from webms to pdfs can be pulled using this bot. It currently only supports a few message boards, but that will increase in the future. If you'd like to contribute, don't hesitate to make a branch, commit changes, and then create a pull request. I'm looking forward to what we can create.

## **What made you create this project**

I grew up on message boards and IRC. I've learned a plethora of things revelant to my career and living from them. So I wanted a bot to pull down media I was interested in (my favorite being Lainchan book threads).

## **Any limitations on which message boards to add**

I don't see any limitations on boards to add. Go nuts, I'm open to anything.

## **How to run?**

You'll need a few things to get this up an running. So here are the steps:

- Get a discord or find a discord that doesn't mind you adding a bot.
- Create a bot on Discord's developer site: [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Get your bot's token
- On the system you're developing on, create an environment variable named DankMemeBotToken and set it to your bot's token.
- Install [nodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Pull down project
- In root of project, run the following commands

```
npm install
node bot.js
```
